### Evaluate a News Articule with Natural Language Processing (NLP) 

We will build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an application to understand the human language, written or oral.

## Following are the project prerequisites:

- Webserver - Node
- Web application framework for routing - Express
- Build tool - Webpack. Using webpack, we will set up the app to have dev and prod environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.
- External script - Service Worker
- External API - MeaningCloud

For the MeaningCloud API: You can find the API [here] (https://www.meaningcloud.com/es). Once you create an account with MeaningCloud, you will be given a license key to start using the API. This API does not require an SDK, so you can skip ahead to step 4 in the instructions.

## Getting started

NPM RUN BUILD-DEV --- OPEN 
NPM RUN BUILD-PRO AND START
